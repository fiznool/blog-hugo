Hi, I'm Tom - a JavaScript consultant based in Bristol, UK.

For the last 12 years I’ve been architecting and developing single-page web applications and mobile apps, primarily using JavaScript. I’ve worked for an early stage startup and an [award-winning mobile agency](http://mubaloo.com/), and for the past 4 years I've been running my own consultancy, [Studio Zeffa](http://studiozeffa.com).

Read on to find out more about the services I offer, my portfolio and previous experience. You can also check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com) and visit my [LinkedIn page](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/fiznool).

If you are interesting in hiring me to work on a web or mobile application, or would like to learn more about the training courses I run, why not [get in touch](mailto:tom.spencer@studiozeffa.com)?

Portfolio
---------

### [Blooms for Bees](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/blooms-for-bees/id1194047897?mt=8)

A smartphone app to track bumblebee populations in the UK, for [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/blooms-for-bees/id1194047897?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.natural_apptitude.bloomsforbees&hl=en_GB).

*   A brand new app, designed and built from the ground up for both iPhone and Android platforms.
*   App users complete a 5 minute survey, taking pictures of bumblebees and categorising them with help from a bee guide.
*   Surveys are submitted to a central server, where researchers confirm the categorisation of the bees.
*   Prototype originally devised for client using wireframe screens to capture detailed requirements.
*   App was built using the Ionic Framework, with custom designs implemented from supplied Photoshop comps.
*   BBC ran [a story on the app](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7Ph-ulzuoOrdTV4RllXOE5SX2c/view) which aired on the local evening news.

### [Flow XO](http://flowxo.com)

A SaaS platform to connect together existing cloud apps into a 'workflow', passing data from each stage to the next.

*   A greenfield project which was built from the ground-up.
*   Worked from requirements and wireframes to architect and build the core app and corresponding admin UI.
*   Collaborated with other developers to create an SDK for building 'services', which connect to individual cloud apps.
*   Built using the MEAN stack - MongoDB, Express, Angular.js and Node.js, using Test-Driven Development.
*   Workflow logic distributed via a message queue and deployed to Heroku to allow for horizontal scaling.
*   Integrated with [Recurly](https://recurly.com) to handle recurring subscription payments.
*   The client is happy with the progress, implementation and stability of the application. In particular, the test-driven nature has led to no major issues in the field.

### [Torpio](http://torpio.com)

A [micro scripting platform](http://torpio.com) for joining up and extending cloud apps.

*   The project was nearing completion when I was hired to audit the codebase.
*   It was clear that the app required a rewrite, which the client agreed to.
*   Static HTML templates were provided, and the responsive web app was built using Backbone.js, consuming a RESTful API.
*   The client is very happy with [the app](http://torpio.com/app), citing the quick run-time performance and modular codebase as two particularly pleasing aspects of the project.

### [Top Value](http://mubaloo.com/clients/hp)

A [responsive product catalogue](http://mubaloo.com/clients/hp) for a leading technology brand.

This app was designed and built by a team at Mubaloo. As Head of Web Team, I was responsible for the development of the app, which was built as a single-page web application using Backbone.js, and integrated with a RESTful API.

The app is now [hosted by the client](http://www.hpchannelapp.com/app/) and is used by sales professionals all over the UK.

### [Pro Attend](http://mubaloo.com/clients/nest)

A hybrid mobile app for iPhone and Android phones to [allow teachers to track student attendance](http://mubaloo.com/clients/nest).

This app was designed and built by a team at Mubaloo. As Head of Web Team, I was responsible for the development of the app, which was built as a hybrid mobile app using Backbone.js, integrating with a RESTful API, and wrapped with PhoneGap.

The app is now live on the [iOS App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/nest-pro-attend/id722282719?mt=8), and is used by trainers all over the UK. The Android version is due to follow.
